# arXivScraper
An ArXiV scraper to retrieve records from given categories and date range.

## Install

Use `pip` (or `pip3` for python3):

```bash
$ pip install arxivscraper
```

or download the source and use `setup.py`:

```bash
$ python setup.py install
```

To update the module using `pip`:
```bash
pip install arxivscraper --upgrade
```

## Examples

### Without filtering

You can directly use `arxivscraper` in your scripts. Let's import `arxivscraper`
and create a scraper to fetch all preprints in condensed matter physics category
from 27 May 2017 until 7 June 2017 (for other categories, see below):

```python
import arxivscraper
scraper = arxivscraper.Scraper(category='physics:cond-mat', date_from='2017-05-27',date_until='2017-06-07')
```
Once we built an instance of the scraper, we can start the scraping:

```python
output = scraper.scrape()
```
While scraper is running, it prints its status:

```
fetching up to  1000 records...
fetching up to  2000 records...
Got 503. Retrying after 30 seconds.
fetching up to  3000 records...
fetching is complete.
```

Finally you can save the output in your favorite format or readily convert it into a pandas dataframe:
```python
import pandas as pd
cols = ('id', 'title', 'categories', 'abstract', 'doi', 'created', 'updated', 'authors')
df = pd.DataFrame(output,columns=cols)
```

### With filtering
To have more control over the output, you could supply a dictionary to filter out the results. As an example, let's collect all preprints related to machine learning. This subcategory (`stat.ML`) is part of the statistics (`stat`) category. In addition, we want those preprints that word `learning` appears in their abstract.

```python
import arxivscraper.arxivscraper as ax
scraper = ax.Scraper(category='stat',date_from='2017-08-01',date_until='2017-08-10',t=10, filters={'categories':['stat.ml'],'abstract':['learning']})
output = scraper.scrape()
```

> In addition to `categories` and `abstract`, other available keys for `filters` are: `author` and `title`.

> Note that filters are based on logical OR and not mutually exclusive. So if the specified word appears in the abstract,
the record will be saved even if it doesn't have the specified categories.

## Arxiv.org Categories

Here is a list of all categories and subcategories available on ArXiv. This is list is up to date 
as of 2025-03-22 and is directly sourced from https://arxiv.org/category_taxonomy. 

> Note: The [v1](categories_v1.md) of this file used python to find the list of categories back in 2017. For v2, I simply fed the html of the page to
[Google AI Studio](aistudio.google.com) and used the following simple prompt to get the list. We have come a long way!

```
At the end of the prompt, I have provided a set of HTML tags that are arranged according to the following guide. Extract these keys and make a nice markdown table out of them.

| Group Name | Archive Name (Archive ID) | Category Name (Category ID) | Category Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Computer Science |  | Computer Science  |  |
|  |  | cs.AI (Artificial Intelligence) | Covers all areas of AI except Vision, Robotics, Machine Learning, Multiagent Systems, and Computation and Language (Natural Language Processing), which have separate subject areas. In particular, includes Expert Systems, Theorem Proving (although this may overlap with Logic in Computer Science), Knowledge Representation, Planning, and Uncertainty in AI. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes I.2.0, I.2.1, I.2.3, I.2.4, I.2.8, and I.2.11. |
|  |  | cs.AR (Hardware Architecture) | Covers systems organization and hardware architecture. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes C.0, C.1, and C.5. |
|  |  | cs.CC (Computational Complexity) | Covers models of computation, complexity classes, structural complexity, complexity tradeoffs, upper and lower bounds. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes F.1 (computation by abstract devices), F.2.3 (tradeoffs among complexity measures), and F.4.3 (formal languages), although some material in formal languages may be more appropriate for Logic in Computer Science. Some material in F.2.1 and F.2.2, may also be appropriate here, but is more likely to have Data Structures and Algorithms as the primary subject area. |
|  |  | cs.CE (Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science) | Covers applications of computer science to the mathematical modeling of complex systems in the fields of science, engineering, and finance. Papers here are interdisciplinary and applications-oriented, focusing on techniques and tools that enable challenging computational simulations to be performed, for which the use of supercomputers or distributed computing platforms is often required. Includes material in ACM Subject Classes J.2, J.3, and J.4 (economics). |
|  |  | cs.CG (Computational Geometry) | Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes I.3.5 and F.2.2. |
|  |  | cs.CL (Computation and Language) | Covers natural language processing. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Class I.2.7. Note that work on artificial languages (programming languages, logics, formal systems) that does not explicitly address natural-language issues broadly construed (natural-language processing, computational linguistics, speech, text retrieval, etc.) is not appropriate for this area. |
|  |  | cs.CR (Cryptography and Security) | Covers all areas of cryptography and security including authentication, public key cryptosytems, proof-carrying code, etc. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes D.4.6 and E.3. |
|  |  | cs.CV (Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition) | Covers image processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, and scene understanding. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes I.2.10, I.4, and I.5. |
|  |  | cs.CY (Computers and Society) | Covers impact of computers on society, computer ethics, information technology and public policy, legal aspects of computing, computers and education. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes K.0, K.2, K.3, K.4, K.5, and K.7. |
|  |  | cs.DB (Databases) | Covers database management, datamining, and data processing. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes E.2, E.5, H.0, H.2, and J.1. |
|  |  | cs.DC (Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing) | Covers fault-tolerance, distributed algorithms, stabilility, parallel computation, and cluster computing. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes C.1.2, C.1.4, C.2.4, D.1.3, D.4.5, D.4.7, E.1. |
|  |  | cs.DL (Digital Libraries) | Covers all aspects of the digital library design and document and text creation. Note that there will be some overlap with Information Retrieval (which is a separate subject area). Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes H.3.5, H.3.6, H.3.7, I.7. |
|  |  | cs.DM (Discrete Mathematics) | Covers combinatorics, graph theory, applications of probability. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes G.2 and G.3. |
|  |  | cs.DS (Data Structures and Algorithms) | Covers data structures and analysis of algorithms. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes E.1, E.2, F.2.1, and F.2.2. |
|  |  | cs.ET (Emerging Technologies) | Covers approaches to information processing (computing, communication, sensing) and bio-chemical analysis based on alternatives to silicon CMOS-based technologies, such as nanoscale electronic, photonic, spin-based, superconducting, mechanical, bio-chemical and quantum technologies (this list is not exclusive). Topics of interest include (1) building blocks for emerging technologies, their scalability and adoption in larger systems, including integration with traditional technologies, (2) modeling, design and optimization of novel devices and systems, (3) models of computation, algorithm design and programming for emerging technologies. |
|  |  | cs.FL (Formal Languages and Automata Theory) | Covers automata theory, formal language theory, grammars, and combinatorics on words. This roughly corresponds to ACM Subject Classes F.1.1, and F.4.3. Papers dealing with computational complexity should go to cs.CC; papers dealing with logic should go to cs.LO. |
|  |  | cs.GL (General Literature) | Covers introductory material, survey material, predictions of future trends, biographies, and miscellaneous computer-science related material. Roughly includes all of ACM Subject Class A, except it does not include conference proceedings (which will be listed in the appropriate subject area). |
|  |  | cs.GR (Graphics) | Covers all aspects of computer graphics. Roughly includes material in all of ACM Subject Class I.3, except that I.3.5 is is likely to have Computational Geometry as the primary subject area. |
|  |  | cs.GT (Computer Science and Game Theory) | Covers all theoretical and applied aspects at the intersection of computer science and game theory, including work in mechanism design, learning in games (which may overlap with Learning), foundations of agent modeling in games (which may overlap with Multiagent systems), coordination, specification and formal methods for non-cooperative computational environments. The area also deals with applications of game theory to areas such as electronic commerce. |
|  |  | cs.HC (Human-Computer Interaction) | Covers human factors, user interfaces, and collaborative computing. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes H.1.2 and all of H.5, except for H.5.1, which is more likely to have Multimedia as the primary subject area. |
|  |  | cs.IR (Information Retrieval) | Covers indexing, dictionaries, retrieval, content and analysis. Roughly includes material in ACM Subject Classes H.3.0, H.3.1, H.3.2, H.3.3, and H.3.4. |
|  |  | cs.IT (Information Theory) | Covers theoretical and experimental aspects of information theory and coding. Includes material in ACM Subject Class E.4 and intersects with H.1.1. |
|  |  | cs.LG (Machine Learning) | Papers on all aspects of machine learning research (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning, bandit problems, and so on) including also robustness, explanation, fairness, and methodology. cs.LG is also an appropriate primary category for applications of machine learning methods. |
|  |  | cs.LO (Logic in Computer Science) | Covers all aspects of logic in computer science, including finite model theory, logics of programs, modal logic, and program verification.

```markdown
## To-do list (code)

* Add command line option to run
* Add functions to filter out the results of API calls based on subcategories
or title/abstract containing specific terms.


## To-do list (documentation)
On command line
`python arxivscraper.py [-c|categories] [-f|from] [-u|until] [-w|waitingtime]`

* `-c`: No default value
* `-f`: Default first day of the current month
* `-u`: Default today
* `-w`: Default: 30 sec
`python arxivscraper.py -c physics -f 2017-06-01 -u 2017-06-06`

Note that the date is in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

At each `API` call, only 1000 records are returned. The scripts waits 30 seconds to make the next call. You can change the waiting time (in seconds) between calls by `-w` flag. Example:

`python arxivscraper.py -c physics -f 2017-06-01 -u 2017-06-06 -w 20`

* The retrieved results also include records updated during the date range even if there created out of this range.
* to access help, `-h`
* To list all categories: to see a list of categories, see [here]().
