# OpenWorld-InorganicChemistry

An open-source platform for inorganic materials discovery, synthesis, and analysis using LLMs and AI Agents.

## Overview

OpenWorld-InorganicChemistry is a powerful, open-source platform designed to accelerate the discovery of new inorganic materials for clean energy, electronics, and other critical applications. By leveraging state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI Agents, this platform automates and streamlines the complex process of materials research.

## Features

- **Materials Discovery**: Predict the properties of novel inorganic materials, including stability, electronic structure, and catalytic activity, using a combination of Density Functional Theory (DFT), machine learning (ML), and AI.
- **Synthesis Planning**: Generate viable synthesis pathways for new materials through retrosynthesis, reaction prediction, and process optimization.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyze and visualize both experimental and computational data with powerful tools for statistical analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, LangChain
- **Database**: MongoDB / PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes
